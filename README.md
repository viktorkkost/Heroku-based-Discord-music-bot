# A Heroku-compatible Discord music bot
## Overview
This is a Python-based Heroku-compatible Discord bot that can search and play videos from YouTube. Only the bare minimum is included here, but with a few changes you can easily run it locally or host in for free on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform). It's intended for personal use in a private server "for friends", although you can do whatever you want with it. It's also easily customizable if you know even a little Python.

Below are explained most of the steps required to make your own bot using this code and host it 24/7 for free.
